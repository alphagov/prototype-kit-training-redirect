# GOV.UK Prototype Kit Redirect

This is a simple CloudFoundry app that redirects all requests to the Prototype
Kit tutorials and examples page.

We use it to redirect the prototype-kit-training.cloudapps.digital domain we
previously used for in-person training (which may be bookmarked by people who
attended our training, and is referred to in documentation ) to our main docs
site (https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com)
